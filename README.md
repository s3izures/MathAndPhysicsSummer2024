How to play
- W A S D keys for movement.
- Pick up the colored circles to unlock the colored gates.
- Don't touch the red walls! They will kill you.

Features
- Movement with translation matrices.
- Bitwise operations regarding the unlocking of gates.
- Custom colliders and collision detection.
- Sound effects
- Score display

Important Note
- Collision is buggy, when hitting corners may glitch out of the level.
- When dragging player across wall, may also glitch out of the level.
I think that the colliders work, but I did not implement the pushback perfectly.
